  * Practical Econometrics bridges the gap between theoretical and practical knowledge of introductory econometrics. The intuition underlying each individual econometric tool is explained, both verbally and visually whenever possible, before introducing the technical details required to actually implement the tool. Particular attention is paid to developing correct interpretation skills and the how-to's associated with effectively communicating the quality of one's work. The goal is to provide readers with not only the desire but also the practical know-how to correctly utilize the econometric tools introduced and thereby increase the true power of the introductory econometrics course. Both Microsoft Excel and Stata software packages provide data examples throughout the text.
